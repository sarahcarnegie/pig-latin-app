# Pig Latin App
I developed this app to teach myself python. The app takes a list of English words in a text file and converts the words to pig latin. 

## How does it convert to pig latin?
It takes the consonant/s from the beginning of each word and places them at the end of the word. It then adds the suffix 'ay'. If the word starts with a vowel it just adds 'ay' to the end. For example monkey becomes 'onkeymay' and apple becomes 'appleay'.

By building this app I learnt:

- List data structure
- Reading and writing text files
- Python language syntax rules
- Data types, variables, and variable scope
- Iteration and logical operators

## How to run the app

- Put your list of English words into `words-in.txt`
- Put each word on a new line
- Run `pig_latin_app.py`
- Check `words-out.txt` for your pig latin words
- To run the tests, run `pig_latin_app_test.py`
